# StarWars
An android app built using Kotlin that consumes [TMDB API]("https://developers.themoviedb.org/3") to display current trending, upcoming and popular moviesüçø and tvshowsüé¨. It has been built following Clean Architecture Principle, Repository Pattern, MVVM Architecture in the presentation layer as well as jetpack components.

## Tech Stack.
- [Hilt](https://github.com/google/hilt) - Dependency Injection library.
- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
    -   [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    - [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
    -   [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
    - [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - Allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
    - [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)-Component that allows easier implementation of navigation from simple button clicks to more complex patterns.
  
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Type-safe http client and supports coroutines out of the box.
- [GSON](https://github.com/square/gson) - JSON Parser,used to parse requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable and default parameters.
  
- [OkHttp-Logging-Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - Logs HTTP request and response data.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines.
- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber)- Library for easier logging.
- [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) - Build awesome beautiful UIs.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)- Image Library from loading images from the database and cacheing in memory.
- [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines,provides runBlocking coroutine builder used in tests.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/VictorKabata/Notflix/actions) - GitHub actions is used in this project to check for syntax correctness using KtLint, execute the unit tests and generate a new package when pushing chanes to the main branch.
